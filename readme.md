# JSON Util

This is just quick little command line tool I threw together to validate some json files.

## Usage

Point the config.json file to the directory of json files and add the keys you'll need to the keys attribute.

```javascript
{
  "src": "<PATH TO JSON DIR>",
  "keys": [
    "key<string>"
  ]
}
```
